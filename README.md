# module-5-challenege

I have completed this challenege with the use of mostly Vanilla javascript. It currently has a bug where when viewing the application deployed on Github the feature that color coats each time block is not working. It seems to only be working on my local host. Other than that I did everything my self except for getting help with the colorized time blocks to update with the real time. I go help from a learning assistant and he helped me in zoom.
